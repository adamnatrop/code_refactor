# code_refactor

This is a homework assignemnt to clean up and update the site for accessability and optimizing both the html and css code. 

    HTML was consolidated to use semantic tags instead of many different class and id tags. 

    HTML file was formatted with proper indentation and structure with updated semantic tags

    CSS was modified to work with new semantic tags and classes/ids updated
